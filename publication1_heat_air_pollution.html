                <h2>Overview and Key Content</h2>
                <p>This technical brief from the World Health Organization (WHO), published on July 17, 2025, is part of the WHO Air Quality, Energy, and Health Science and Policy Summaries (SPS) series. It addresses the increasing global phenomenon of heatwaves and prolonged excess heat conditions, which are growing in frequency, duration, intensity, and magnitude due to climate change.[1]</p>
                <p>The core of this publication is the synergistic health impacts resulting from combined exposure to heat stress and air pollution. It explains how these environmental factors interact to amplify adverse health outcomes.[2] The brief not only outlines the problem but also details priority actions for short, medium, and long-term implementation to protect public health. It also showcases successful initiatives and case studies where these intertwined issues have been jointly addressed, offering practical examples for global application.[1]</p>

                <h2>Related Health Issues and Vulnerable Populations</h2>
                <p>Heat directly and acutely impacts health, leading to a documented increase in mortality rates worldwide, especially during heatwaves.[2, 3] Direct heat-related illnesses include heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and hyperthermia. Even minor deviations from seasonal average temperatures are linked to increased illness and death.[3]</p>
                <p>Beyond direct impacts, heat significantly worsens pre-existing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, stroke), respiratory ailments (COPD, lower respiratory infections, asthma), diabetes, and mental health conditions.[2, 3] Heat can also indirectly increase the risk of accidents and the transmission of certain infectious diseases.[3]</p>
                <p>Air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone, is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).[2] Its health impacts extend beyond the lungs to affect nearly all organs, including the heart, brain, and reproductive system.[2] A critical synergistic effect occurs during heatwaves, where increased temperatures and sunlight accelerate chemical reactions, leading to higher ground-level ozone formation.[2] The combined effects of heat stress and air pollution are well-documented for all-cause mortality, as well as for mortality and morbidity specifically related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.[2] Evidence suggests that the mortality effects of heatwave days are more pronounced when levels of ozone or PM10 are elevated, particularly among the elderly population.[3]</p>

                <h3>Vulnerable Populations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Infants, Young Children, Newborns, and Pregnant Women:</strong> Highly susceptible to heat-related morbidity and mortality. Heat can adversely affect birth outcomes, including changes in gestation length, birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal stress.[2, 3]</li>
                    <li><strong>Older Adults (especially those over 65):</strong> Reduced central nervous system responsiveness to temperature changes and difficulties maintaining hydration put them at higher risk.[3, 4, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Individuals with Chronic Conditions and Disabilities:</strong> Those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health issues, or on specific medications face elevated risks. Reduced mobility or impaired capacity to implement self-cooling measures further increases risk.[2, 3]</li>
                    <li><strong>Outdoor and Manual Workers:</strong> Vulnerable to exertional heat stress due to occupational exposure, leading to fatigue, impaired judgment, and increased accident risk.[2, 3]</li>
                    <li><strong>Urban and Rural Poor:</strong> Often experience higher heat exposure due to factors like substandard housing and inadequate access to cooling facilities.[2]</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender-Specific Vulnerabilities:</strong> Gender can influence heat exposure, e.g., women's primary responsibility for indoor cooking during hot weather.[2]</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Symptoms of Heat-Related Illnesses and Air Pollution Exposure</h2>
                <h3>Heat-Related Illnesses:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heat Exhaustion:</strong> Heavy sweating, cold, pale, clammy skin, fast/weak pulse, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, tiredness, dizziness, headache, fainting.[6] Untreated, it can progress to heatstroke.[6]</li>
                    <li><strong>Heatstroke (Medical Emergency):</strong> Core body temperature of 103°F (40°C) or higher. Signs include hot, red, dry skin (though exertional heatstroke may have profuse sweating), fast/strong pulse, headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, agitation, slurred speech, delirium, seizures, and loss of consciousness.[4, 6] Can rapidly damage vital organs, leading to permanent disability or death if not promptly treated.[4]</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Air Pollution Exposure (Respiratory Symptoms):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asthma:</strong> Air pollutants (ground-level ozone, particle pollution, gases like carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide) irritate airways, causing swelling and tightening.[7] Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing.[8] Long-term exposure increases asthma risk, especially in young children.[8] Climate-driven warming extends pollen seasons, triggering allergic asthma attacks.[8] Wildfire smoke is also a trigger.[8]</li>
                    <li><strong>COPD Exacerbation:</strong> Worsening of typical COPD symptoms, often triggered by lung infections or irritating environmental substances like air pollution.[9, 10] Symptoms include increased breathlessness, more severe/frequent cough, changes in sputum color/amount, heightened fatigue, and potentially signs of elevated carbon dioxide levels (headache upon waking, confusion, difficulty waking).[9, 10] Chest tightness and wheezing may also intensify.[10]</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Prevention and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
                <h3>For Heat Stress:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Staying Cool:</strong> Seek air-conditioned environments (malls, libraries). Electric fans are insufficient above 95°F (35°C); cool showers or baths are more effective.[11, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintaining Hydration:</strong> Drink ample fluids (water, sports drinks) even if not thirsty. Avoid alcohol. Consult healthcare provider if fluid intake is limited by medical conditions.[11, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate Clothing:</strong> Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, light-colored clothing.[11, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Limiting Outdoor Activity:</strong> Schedule strenuous activities for cooler parts of the day (mornings, evenings). Rest frequently in shade. Gradually acclimatize to hot environments.[11, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Use sunscreen (SPF 15+), wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses to prevent sunburn, which impairs cooling.[11, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Care:</strong> Regularly check on vulnerable individuals (older adults, friends, family, neighbors). Ensure pets have water. Never leave people or pets in vehicles.[11, 5]</li>
                    <li><strong>Staying Informed:</strong> Monitor local news and weather for heat warnings.[11, 5]</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For Air Pollution Exposure:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reducing Outdoor Exposure:</strong> Minimize time outdoors on high air pollution days.[12]</li>
                    <li><strong>Improving Indoor Air Quality:</strong> Keep windows closed, especially with AC. Use portable or central air cleaning systems with effective filters (e.g., 5-inch pleated media filters, electrostatic air cleaners).[12]</li>
                    <li><strong>Limiting Indoor Sources:</strong> Use environmentally safer paints/cleaning products. Properly seal chemical containers. Conserve electricity. Reduce or eliminate fireplace/wood stove use on high pollution days. Avoid gas-powered lawn equipment and burning leaves/trash.[13]</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintaining Ventilation:</strong> Ensure proper ventilation to control moisture and dilute indoor pollutants, especially after weatherization.[13]</li>
                    <li><strong>Reducing Physical Exertion:</strong> Limit strenuous physical activity, particularly outdoors and near pollution sources.[12]</li>
                    <li><strong>Asthma/COPD Management:</strong> Follow prescribed action plans and report worsening symptoms to healthcare providers. Avoid triggers like smoke, fumes, cleaning products.[6]</li>
                </ul>
